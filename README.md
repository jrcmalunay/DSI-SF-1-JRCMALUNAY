#### Summary
Truly enjoyed the 12 week program; begging with python fundamentals to machine learning algorithms using big data visualizations. Data minging, data munging, and data cleaning were easily accomplished numpy and pandas packages. In additon, scrapy and xpath using requests for APIs were used to extract data.

Further analysis needed scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms) such as:
- KNearest Neighbors
- Linear and Logistic Regressions 
- Clustering
- **NLP** (TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer)

Visualizaitons were created using matplotlib and seaborn packages.
